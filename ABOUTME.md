## Web Programming Intro Assignment

I am currently a senior Computer Engineering major and I have taken the following Computer Science 
Courses:
* Computer Science I
* Computer Science II
* Object Oriented Programming
* Software Engineering

… as well as the following relevant CE courses (i.e. those that involve programing):
* Digital Systems Design
* Introduction to Computer Architecture
* C/C++
* Microcontroller System Design (and Lab)
* Embedded Systems

Through these courses I have had experience with Java, C, C++, some Python,
ARM Assembly Language, MIPS Assembly Language, and Verilog. My personal 
favorite project was done for Software Engineering, in which I led my group in an 
attempted to design a functional RSR Digital I/O Module (pictured below) in Unreal 
Engine 4. Since this module is used in Digital Logic Lab, the idea for the project 
was that it could be used by students outside of class. Working on this project in Unreal Engine 4 introduced us to the concept of visual programming, which is what made it stand out for me.

I am primarily taking this course to broaden out my skillset; I
have almost no experience with the technologies and 
languages we plan to cover, and I signed up for this course to
change that. It is unlikely that I will use what is learned in this 
class directly, assuming I work in embedded systems and/or 
computer architecture as I hope. However, I will be able to use 
what we learn to create applications to aide in the process. For 
example, some of the applications I’ve used so far are 
extremely antiquated such that they don’t run properly on 
modern devices. There may come a time where I need to or at 
least just want to create an updated version of said app that 
can run on platforms other than Windows.
